# Final-Year-Project (gyroscopic balancing bike with weight shifter arm)



This repository contains necessary resources to recreate a self-balancing bike using a single axis gyroscope.
All the working code, MATLAB simulation files, component connection diagram and a svg file for laser cutting to build a physical prototype are included.
Your computer should have Python and Arduino IDE installed to build this project and MATLAB (optional) for running Simulink files and modeling code.
